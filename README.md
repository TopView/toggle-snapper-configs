# toggle-snapper-configs
For btrfs snapshots:  Quickly and easily toggle Snapper's automatic features, 

NOTE: Append '?ts=4' to URL to use tabs=4.  
     (Sorry, but I don't know why github is so stubborn about better support or tabs, 
     but I love 4 char tabs, and have nbeen using them for decades, and have no intention 
     to stop using them.  tabs > spaces.)
